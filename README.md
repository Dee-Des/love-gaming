## Colors

Color selection is a key component to any design process, however with the nature of the project this consideration is even greater due to the end user being a fan of Pokemon and the importance of color in Pokeman images. 

The artwork and color selection thus played an integral part in the design of this project as they were essential in creating a welcoming and appropriate page for the end user and their Pokemon themed game.

## Fonts

As with color, font was a big consideration for ensuring a positive user experience whilst visiting the page.<br>

### Wireframes

These low-fidelity wireframes have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the key feature layout to guide the user experience design.

## Imagery

The image selection became a key influence in the design of the overall project.

With the requirements of the end user in mind, I sought out images that would fulfil specific criteria:
- Easily identifiable and appealing to the target audience

## Features

### General Features

In order to fulfil the criteria the page consists of 



various sectioned information each with a variety of links, resources 

Some key adjustments: 

- The inclusion of buttons within the hero section.<br>
This was done to reflect the clearly definied section of content and provide the user an easy navigation link to the section they would most likely be seeking to interact with. 

- Opting not centre all content within their respective parents.<br>
This decision was made as a result of personal reflection and user feedback to provide a more enjoyable user experience.


#### Links and Buttons

The page uses a primary colour for buttons to adhere to contrast requirements as well as appealing to Pokeman fans.

### Responsive Design

Utilising additional CSS or media queries allowed for an implementation that is responsive. 

Though it took some experimentation and troubleshooting, I have been able to create a page that is fully responsive to modern standards.
